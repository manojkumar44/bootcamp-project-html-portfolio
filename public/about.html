<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello folks. I'm Manoj and I'm a freelance web developer based out in West London. I've been designing and building
websites as well asaddressing existing website issues for clients since 2012 and am currently upskilling on Udemy.</p>

<p>This website behaves as a simple portfolio to demonstrate basic to advanced proficiency in HTML. Whilst I'm well versed
with hand coding web layouts from scratch using HTML and styling pages with CSS, I nonetheless opted to complete this Project.</p>

<p>My prefered development stack is WAMP/LAMP (Windows/Linux, Apache, MySQL with PHP) but I'm equally at home with using 
the Wordpress CMS and tools such as Elementor to build awesome user-experiences and websites. For Bespoke web applications I'll
stick with PHP as my go-to technology for back-end web development and for building robust dynamic web applications though that 
could change once I complete this bootcamp!</p>
